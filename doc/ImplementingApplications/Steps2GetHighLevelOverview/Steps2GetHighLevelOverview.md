## Steps to get a high-level overview 
A single specification may contain at least 2000 lines. So, reading the specification line by line is a bit overwhelming.
To get a quick high-level overview of the requirement,
1.	Go to the link https://editor.swagger.io/ 
2.	Copy the entire specification and paste it in the swagger editor window
3.	After pasting the specification , to the right side of editor window, the swagger user interface will be loaded.
4.	From this swagger user interface , we can understand the different categories of services, url path , content of the request body and response body , specified security schemes , callbacks etc.,
