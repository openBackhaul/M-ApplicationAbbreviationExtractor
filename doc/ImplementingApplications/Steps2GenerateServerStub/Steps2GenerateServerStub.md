## Server Stub Generation

The server-side code is generated from the API specification according to the following process:
1)	Go to https://editor.swagger.io/
2)	Copy the Yaml file content to the swagger editor
3)	Go to Menu -> Generate Server -> Nodejs-server
4)	This will generate server-side stub in a zip file, and it will be downloaded to $USER_HOME/Downloads/nodejs-server-server-generated.zip.
